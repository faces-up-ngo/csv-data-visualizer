In Airtable: Export the student intake form into a CSV file

### Data visualizer tool
* Make sure you are connected to the internet
* Start the [data visualizer tool](https://faces-up-ngo.github.io/csv-data-visualizer/), ideally use your bookmarked link with the API key. Enter the API key if not done previously.
* Choose your type of analysis by selecting a so-called "preset" from the dropdown list and press `load preset`.
